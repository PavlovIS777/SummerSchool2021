No, you answer me! It was Franciscos voice. Stop and identify yourself
Bernardo stopped. Long live the King!
Im giving you this bail intending
To reward you more just and fair
By worthy of your lofty feeling
Suffused with consecrated dream
The Poetry serene and living
Not for the high life entertaining
Just being charmed by friendly care
The thoughts and ease in high esteem
But let it be your care revealing
Accept the florid chapters row
Semi amusing semi-wistfuls
Ideal folkish sometimes blissful
What my lightheaded pen did draw
The fruits of vigils inspirations
Immature and now faded years
Of the cold minds observations
And of my heart so doleful breaths
Bernardo climbed the stairs to the castles ramparts. It was a bitterly cold night. He made his way carefully through the freezing fog to relieve Francisco of his guard duty. He saw a dim figure and challenged him.
Whos there
