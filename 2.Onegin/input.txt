Such were a young rakes meditations
by will of Zeus the high and just
the legatee of his relations
as horses whirled him through the dust
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila
without preliminary feeler
let me acquaint you on the nail
with this the hero of my tale
Onegin my good friend was littered
and bred upon the Nevas brink
where you were born as well I think
reader or where youve shone and glittered
There once I too strolled back and forth
but Im allergic to the North
